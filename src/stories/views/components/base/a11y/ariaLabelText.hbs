{{!--@
Creates a text element that is only relevant for screenreaders. It will not be visible at all.

```hbs
{{> base/a11y/hiddenText
    _text="..."
    _locaTag="..."
    }}
```

`_text`     The text for the screen reader.<br>
`_locaTag`  The loca tag for the text for the screen reader.<br>

HINWEIS:
The aria-label attribute is used to provide an accessible name for an element, 
but it should only be applied to elements that can have a role where it makes 
sense to provide such a label. A <span> element by itself does not have an implicit 
role that supports an aria-label.

DON'T USE THIS ANYMORE
